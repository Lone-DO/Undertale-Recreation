		<p>
			 <font color="red">Issue:</font> On DRM-free OSX version, says "Application is damaged and must move to trash."
		</p>
		<p>

</ul>

<h2>WINDOWS</h2><br>
<ul>
	 <li>

</ul> 




<font color="red">Issue:</font> I have a European keyboard and Z,X, and C are in inconvenient locations.<br>

<font color="lime">Resolve:</font> You can also use ENTER for Z , SHIFT for X, and CTRL for C. This way you can play the game one-handed. Or you can just use a joypad.<br><br>


<font color="red">Issue:</font> Doing an action, game crashes with an error message // OR // Some other strange bug that does not crash the game but is clearly unintended // OR // Game consistently crashes/freezes at a certain point<br>

<font color="lime">Resolve:</font> <a href="contact.html">E-mail</a> me immediately, I will try to fix the issue.<br><br>


<font color="red">Issue:</font> Plane turns tiny.<br>

<font color="lime">Resolve:</font> No resolve. Intentional.<br><br>


<font color="red">Issue:</font> Are you sure? That really seems like a bug.<br>

<font color="lime">Resolve:</font> IT'S ON PURPOSE!!!!!!!
