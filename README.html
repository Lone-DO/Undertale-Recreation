			<h1>UnderTale Recreation... README</h1>
			<h2>
				The purpose of this project is to reinvent the original Site into something even more
			</h2><br>
			<p>
				Shocked to see that the Devs constructed their site in pure Inline Coding,<br>
				Analyzing it there is no such external files such as Dedicatted .CSS files nor .JS,<br>
				As well as no Actual text/ paragraphs to be found. Everything is an image n  spaced out with "br's"<br><br>
				My Objective is to reconstruct this wonderful piece and impliment my own personal vision.<br>
				ATM currently a Treehouse Student, I'll be utilizing my gained knowledge thereof here and future endevours as well.<br>
